# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe? The most difficult part to tic-tac-toe was definitely the has_won() function. It was initially difficult to implement all of the winning scenarios, but as we went through it in class, it was much easier.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game. I would add a computer player to the game most likely by coding in a function for a player to choose what symbol they'd like to be. After this, I would implement the query system from the other assignment.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it. I would implement search methods that will help the computer player look for common winning patterns to replicate. There would most likely be winning and losing cases that the AI would be programmed to recognize.
